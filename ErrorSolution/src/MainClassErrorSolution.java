	/**
	 * 
	 * First check this:
Right click on your project>>properties>>JavaBuildPath>>Libraries.
If there are any red flags, remove and attach the library again.
Furthermore, check your .classpath file, it should have correct paths to your main.
Finally, you can click Project -> Clean.
I also suggest using Maven, as it helps with those type of issues
